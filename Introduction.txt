Intoduction

For this final assignment, I have chosen to find a neighborhood in Toronto to build Chinese restaurant. I think, using supply and demand laws, building such restaurant should be in the neighborhood where percentage of Chinese people living in that area must be high and where there should be not many chinese restaurants, so that we can avoid competition. 

Business problem

My job here is to find optimal location for the restaurant so that restaurant could be profitable and prosper in the area.
